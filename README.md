# Self_Balancing_Bot
Immediate and efficient medical assistance is one of the important factors that contributes to minimise the loss of life during a disaster. Making sure that hospitals and shelter camps are well staffed and well stocked is extremely important to ensure patient survival. During a disaster like Cyclone Fani, shelter camps tend to get crowded because of so many people arriving at once to take shelter at the camp. Moreover, access to trained hospital staff like nurses might be limited. In such cases, bipedal robots may be employed to perform tasks like transporting supplies from one part of the camp to another. Bipedal robots such as these need to be able to balance on their own two feet. They should also be able to navigate through cluttered and congested spaces.
